I stated creating static sites in 2015 with a generator integrated to Github called Jekyll and hosted (for free) using github pages. For the techies, you can see the move happened with this very commit.\nI think my old website will still be accessible in the future using the wayback machine to get some details on how it was previously built, maybe you can check (beware: as soon as you click the link, you will be travelling back in time!) by clicking here. For those of you who are afraid to click, and that is understandable (you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to be lost in a parallel universe would you), you will notice a slight difference in the URL of the website. Indeed, I used HTTP and not HTTPS, remember that the S stands for Secured, what a crazy idea! As google wrote in a post back in 2018:\n For the past several years, we‚Äôve moved toward a more secure web by strongly advocating that sites adopt HTTPS encryption. And within the last year, we‚Äôve also helped users understand that HTTP sites are not secure by gradually marking a larger subset of HTTP pages as ‚Äúnot secure‚Äù. Beginning in July 2018 with the release of Chrome 68, Chrome will mark all HTTP sites as ‚Äúnot secure‚Äù.\n Of course Google was right and I was surprised to discover that sites load slower using HTTP rather than HTTPS, even if you think the added encryption mechanism would slower things down: isn\u0026rsquo;t that counterintuitive ? Take a look here to understand.\nLooking back at my \u0026ldquo;behind the scenes of this website\u0026rdquo; I also mentioned ATOM to be my source code editor, which is not the case anymore. I switched to Visual Studio Code and I\u0026rsquo;m very happy with it. Anyway the funny ATOM launching video is still on Youtube and I still like it a lot, especially when grandma switches the colors to black and green üëµ üíª! No comparable video for Visual Studio Code üòè.\nFor the rest, I still use Github pages and I\u0026rsquo;ll explore more differences in a new post one day!\n","date":1587937721,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587937721,"objectID":"f0e9db2a79820eb8d50e757210425a6d","permalink":"https://remisharrock.fr/post/starting-my-academic-page/","publishdate":"2020-04-26T23:48:41+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/starting-my-academic-page/","section":"post","summary":"So here is my first blog post switching from an old static website generator to a new one called Hugo and a theme called academic.

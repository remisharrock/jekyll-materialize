**Today**

I am an associate professor (teaching &amp; research) at [Telecom ParisTech][1] (the old name is ENST - Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Telecommunications) since september 2012. Funny fact: in 1904 this engineer school invented the word "[telecommunication][2]" :smile: !

**Yesterday**

In 2010, I joined [INRIA][3] - [LaBRI][4] as a post-doctoral research scientist and I taught at [ENSEIRB-MATMECA][5], both located in Bordeaux, France.

**The day before yesterday**

I was born in Sherbrooke, Canada but my parents quickly moved first to Paris, then south to Toulouse. Part of my family is living in Poland and in some other spots of the world (USA, Canada, U.K.). Fortunately and because of that, I love to travel.

**Tomorrow**

Feel free to contact me for research projects (consulting offers, job inquiries, expertise requests, reference requests, getting back in touch) ! The main keywords of my research are: distributed systems, autonomic computing and networking protocols. However, I'm also interesed in more "marketing-buzzing-and-not-so-much-academic" keywords like cloud computing, grid computing and green-IT: see the [research page][6] for more details.
